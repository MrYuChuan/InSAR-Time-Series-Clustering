# InSAR-Time-Series-Clustering
First version of the code linked to the November submission to International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation.

Automated and unsupervised approach based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA), K-means clustering, Linear regression and Fast Fourier Transform to detect and analyze patterns of ground deformation from InSAR Time Series.
